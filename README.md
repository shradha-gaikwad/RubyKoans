RubyKoans
=========

The path to enlightenment: aka a TDD approach to learning Ruby
The Ruby Koans are a great way to learn about the Ruby language. This Ruby Koans Online is an abridged version of the Koans in the convenience of a browser.

However, if this is your first time through the Koans, we recommend you read the introduction below to find out how the Koans work.

The Path to Enlightenment

Each page consists of a number of tests that you have to complete and any information you might require to help you make those test pass. You can run the tests by clicking the Meditate button at any time or by pressing the Enter key when filling in any of the tests.

Red, Green, Refactor

In test-driven development (TDD) the mantra has always been

red : write a failing test and run it,
green : write just enough code to make the test pass, and
refactor : look at the code to see if you can make it any better.
With the Ruby Koans Online,

the tests will start in the failing state (background is green)
type what you expect the result(s) to be in the input box(es) provided to make the test pass ( background becomes green)
then take a moment to reflect upon the test to see what it is teaching you and, if required, improve the code to better communicate its intent (refactor)

In TDD you will write a test with an expectation of how you want the code to behave and then write the actual code to make that test pass.

This might seem confusing in the case of the Ruby Koans, where most of the test is usually written for you.
In Koans you are providing what your expectation is, so the test framework reports your expectations vs actual results.
